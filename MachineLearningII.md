## Machine Learning - Model Research

### Describe how Teachable Machine uses machine learning to come up with solutions to an arbitrary problem.

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool developed by Google that allows users to create machine learning models without needing to write code. It uses a process called transfer learning to make machine learning accessible and easy to use for a wide range of problems. Hereâ€™s how it applies machine learning to solve problems:

**1. Problem Definition**

- The user defines the problem they want to solve, such as image classification, sound recognition, or pose detection.

**2. Data Collection**

- The user gathers and uploads training data directly into the tool. This data is specific to the problem they want to solve.

- For image classification, the user uploads labeled images. For sound recognition, they record or upload audio samples. For pose detection, they provide examples of body poses.

- These examples serve as labeled data for the machine learning model.

**3. Model Training**

- Teachable Machine uses pre-trained models as a starting point. These models have already been trained on large datasets and have learned general features

- The tool fine-tunes these pre-trained models using the user's specific dataset. This process is called transfer learning.

- During training, the model learns to associate the user's input data (e.g., images, sounds, or poses) with the corresponding labels.

**4. Inference & Predictionn**

- After training, users can test the model to see if it correctly classifies new samples(e.g., new images, sounds, or poses).

- This step helps in fine-tuning the model by adding more examples or adjusting the training parameters if needed.

- The model makes predictions based on what it has learned, and the user can evaluate its accuracy.

**5. Exporting the Model**

- Once the model performs well, the user can export it in various formats, such as TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Lite, or a hosted cloud API.

- The exported model can be integrated into websites, apps, or other projects.
