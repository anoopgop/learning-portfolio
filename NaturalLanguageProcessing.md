####  Solving Problems with Microsoft Copilot

**Steps Taken in Interacting with LLM Models**

- First select Microsoft copilot as the LLM Model

- Download the text book from gutenberg project website. For the demonstration I have selected the book Among the camps.
  The website gives different formats of the books that can be downloaded. I selected the rich text format.

- logged on to Microsoft copilot and uploaded the text file.

- The model gave the synopsis of the book with the key themes and messages

#### Limitations or Challenges I faced

The LLM responses are based on the data trained or available. some of the challenges I faced are as below 

- I have asked for the no of pages for the latest edition of the book and was expecting a definite number where the model was able to give only an approximation.

- I have asked for how many copies have been sold in the US and the model doesnt have the answer for it

- Some time it doesnt interpret the question the user is asking for.


#### Patterns of LLM that I noticed

Below are the patterns I noticed

- Formal and polite way of conversation. The model after completing the answer it will open a dialogue the user to ask for more question in a polite and professional way for example.  _If you have any other questions or need more details, feel free to ask! _

- Contextual understanding of the current conversation. I will maintain the history of the conversation and provides consistent answers

- Faster restrieval of data. If ask questions about the characters in the book it is way faster to answer them.
